## Error Message Strategies

* think of ways to provide the context in a more user-friendly way
    * colorize and label sibling symbols
    * try rendering html for colorization so that we can use box model and hover states
    * provide/generate examples for each of the rules
* imagine the expected tokens and see which one yields a longer parse,
then suggest the better one to the user
* improve lexer error output
* build test suite to easily get overview

## Longer Term

* make own bottom-up parser?
* more languages: LISP, SQL, arithmetic, XML, a simplified JS or Python
* Small subset of JS to compare with Acorn and Esprima in perf
