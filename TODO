* make own bottom-up parser?
* improve lexer error output
* do another recursive descent parser with better error output
* build test suite to easily get overview

## Error Message Strategies

* imagine the expected tokens and see which one yields a longer parse,
then suggest the better one to the user
* reverse walk the tree to provide user more context

## Longer Term

* more languages: LISP, SQL, arithmetic, XML, a simplified JS or Python
* Small subset of JS to compare with Acorn and Esprima in perf
